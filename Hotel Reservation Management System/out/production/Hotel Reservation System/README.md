# Hotel Reservation System
## Requirements Description
The following is a description of an online Hotel Reservation System that will be used to 
enter reservations as well as to check guests in and out of the hotel. 
The hotel management’s desire is to have a system that is constructed in Java. 
The system itself should present a view for the customers to make online room reservations 
as well as a view for the employees or administrators of the hotel to interface with to manage 
the rooms in the system. Each customer should be able to browse available hotel rooms – this should 
present the customer with the type, description, price and availability of the rooms. Each hotel room
is assigned a quality level (e.g. a larger room or a room with a view would be better than a smaller room
without a view). Each room also has a certain number and type of beds, a room number, and a smoking/non-smoking status. 
Each quality level has a daily rate determined by the hotel administrator. When a hotel guest wishes to make an online reservation, 
the system must ask him or her which nights he or she wants to stay and the type of room he or she wants.
The system must verify if room(s) are available on those nights before allowing a reservation to be made.
The hotel needs to record basic information about each guest, such as his or her name, address, telephone number, credit card etc. 
A reservation can be canceled online at any time but some fees (a percentage of the room price) may be charged if the 
cancelation is done within 24 hours of reservation date. A reservation cannot be canceled or modified once it has started.
When a guest checks in, the administrator or hotel employee must update the system to reflect the particular room
allocated to the incoming guest. Similarly, when a guest checks out, the room occupied should be returned to the pool
of available rooms. The administrators should be able to update availability and description of hotel rooms available
for reservation within the system, update their prices and quantities. Administrators should be able to add other
administrators as well as add/remove guest accounts. A hotel guest should initially register for an account before
making any room reservations. The system should handle any faults or unexpected scenarios gracefully. It should be
reliable and should allow for multiple customer requests during the course of execution.

Specific actions/events that should be handled as part of the system:

1. Administrators/Employees/Guests Login & Registration
2. Browsing Rooms
3. Updating Room descriptions, Room availability
4. Reservations/Cancellations/Modifications to reservations
5. Any other events that you may consider from the description above
